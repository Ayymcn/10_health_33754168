    <h2>About <%= appName %></h2>
    <p>
      <%= appName %> is a campus-based service dedicated to supporting
      the health and wellbeing of everyone at Goldsmiths, University of London.
      We combine friendly, student‑focused care with the standards you would
      expect from an NHS‑linked medical service.

      <h3>Our mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide accessible, high‑quality primary care that helps
        students and staff stay physically and mentally well throughout their time
        at university. We focus on prevention, early support, and clear advice so
        you can make confident decisions about your health.
      </p>
      <p>
        From minor illnesses and routine checks to ongoing conditions and wellbeing
        concerns, our clinicians work with you to find the right plan, and to
        connect you with wider university and community services where needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Who we support</h3>
      <p>
        GoldCare is here for all registered Goldsmiths students and staff, including
        international students and those living both on and off campus. We understand
        the pressures of deadlines, exams, work and life in London, and we tailor our
        clinics and appointment times around the academic year.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are new to the UK healthcare system, our team can help you navigate
        NHS services, explain how to register with a GP, and make sure you know
        where to go in urgent or out‑of‑hours situations.
      </p>

      <h3>How we work</h3>
      <p>
        GoldCare operates by booked appointments, with some same‑day slots reserved
        for more urgent issues. You can register online, request a routine review,
        or book a follow‑up after a previous visit using this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work closely with Goldsmiths wellbeing, counselling, disability and
        student support teams so that your medical care fits into the wider support
        available on campus, not just one‑off appointments.
      </p>

      <h3>Our values</h3>
      <p>
        Every consultation is confidential, inclusive and non‑judgemental. We aim
        to create a calm, welcoming environment where you feel listened to and
        respected, whatever you come to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to evidence‑based practice, clear communication and
        continuous improvement, so that GoldCare remains a trusted part of
        the Goldsmiths community for years to come.
